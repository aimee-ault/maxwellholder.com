title: "&ldquo;Funemployment&rdquo;"

Last Thursday was my final day working at [SciMed
Solutions](http://scimedsolutions.com), a Ruby on Rails shop here in Durham.

It was my first "real" job and I could not imagine a better place to start out.

I started work as a Software Tester the day after I graduated with a big
interest in understanding how everything worked. This quickly led me into doing
development work full-time which I picked up through pairing with my very
patient coworkers.

This was an awesome opportunity but after living in North Carolina my whole
life, I'm looking for a change of scenery (ideally somewhere with less humidity
and less pollen).

Until I find that place (pretty sure it's going to be San Francisco), I'm
currently what they call "funemployed", which is what software developers call
being unemployed.

But instead of just laying around, I plan on using this time productively
by pursuing things that likely won't make me any money (in addition to some
plain old laying around).

After two years of working 8-4, I've built up a small set of things I've wanted
to learn more about, but was too exhausted at the end of working all day to look
at deeply.

I also want to make an assessment of my current development skills and fill in
the gaps so I can apply for my next job with confidence.

## Skills

I've certainly learned a lot over the last two years, mainly back-end stuff.

It originally surprised me how little any of the computer science courses I took
actually prepared me for what day-to-day web development looks like.

However, picking up stuff on the job like version control and how to use
relational databases effectively did help teach me a new way to learn things
slowly over time.

Today I can say with confidence that I am familiar enough with Ruby and Rails
that I could jump on most projects without any trouble.

I've built up an understanding of how the web works from the nitty-gritty
details of IP/TCP/HTTP (that networking course I took did really help there) to
the practical skills of setting up a web server.

## Gaps

My biggest gaps are on the front-end.

I know enough Javascript to get what I want done, but without any coherent
organizational philosophy it can easily turn into jQuery spaghetti.

My CSS knowledge is pretty much limited to googling and trying stuff until it
works.

Again, I can accomplish most of what I need to but it can get messy. I think this
is mostly the result of me not really understanding at a deep level the
fundamental box model, how floating works, etc.

## New tech I'm excited about

At the same time as I hone my front-end web development skills, a bunch of new
technologies have sprung up in the last few years I want to take a look at.

[**Ember.js**](http://emberjs.com) offers the organizational philosophy that I think my current JS
knowledge lacks.

I find the strategy of having a separate front-end that just communicates the
bare minimum it needs to with a back-end API very appealing.

I am also very much on board with the strategy of solving a problem once and
reusing others' solutions, which can be tricky unless you have agreed upon a
framework of how to organize basic components.

[**Elixir**](http://elixir-lang.org) seems like the solution to a lot of Ruby's
downsides (distributed/concurrent programming) without really losing any of it's
benefits (very friendly syntax, high productivity).

The immutability and functional style also matches up with how I like to write Ruby so much
that in the little Elixir I've done so far, I've noticed very little difference
with how I would do it in Ruby. If I'm already writing in a functional style, I
might as well do it in a language that takes advantage of that.

[**Rust**](http://rust-lang.org) looks like a big solution to my aversion to doing manual memory
management while still offering massive speed improvements over other higher
level languages.

With the 1.0 release not too far off, it is starting to stabilize to a point
where learning it is more feasible, but my efforts into it so far have resulted
in a bit more trouble than it seemed worth.

## Goals

To keep myself semi-accountable, I'll outline some goals here for the coming
months that I may completely change at some later point:

1. Organize an awesome [RailsBridge Triangle](http://railsbridgetriangle.com/) event this summer

    I helped organize a previous RailsBridge event and TA'd at a RailsGirls event
    and had a ton of fun both times.

    As the head organizer of the next event this summer, I want to focus on how to
    best introduce Rails to people unfamiliar with web development and pull in a more
    diverse group of people into our community.

2. Create some kind of mailing list that sends out some documentation explaining
   how to use a different Unix utility every week

    Have you ever seen someone use a Unix utility you've never seen before and
    wished you had heard about it sooner? I certainly have and I'd like to make
    something that helps others discover semi-obscure Unix tools and learn how to
    use them.

    This would not only force me to learn a lot of new Unix utilities, but also how
    to compose and send out mass emails, which is something I don't have a lot of
    experience with.

3. Go through the Ember.js/Elixir/[Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) tutorials and make some toy web app
   that uses Ember.js on the front-end with Phoenix on the back-end

    This combines all the tech that I want to learn about into one application. I
    would like to learn more about WebSockets, which Phoenix can work with pretty
    easily I hear but is something I have zero experience with.

4. Learn enough Elixir/OTP to write some kind of basic [MUD
   game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD)

    I've always wanted to make a MUD type game, but always kind of knew that Ruby
    wasn't the best tool for it. As I learn more about OTP, I'm realizing that it
    provides some very handy abstractions that would make this kind of application
    much easier to write.

5. Learn more about Erlang by reading some of [Joe Armstrong's
   thesis](http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf)

    I was blown away when someone mentioned how some telecommunications software was
    running with nine nines (!) of availability. I want to know how they managed this
    and in the 80s no less!

6. Blog some more

    I hate that feeling of finding a problem, solving it, knowing that I should blog
    about it, but then not going to the effort of putting it out there.

    I want to share some of the things I've learned to help people in the future
    because I've definitely benefited from reading other peoples' blog posts in the
    past.

## Let's get started!

I'm super excited to have the opportunity to devote myself full-time to just
learning stuff I want to learn.

At the same time, I'd love to hear from you if you are looking for a passionate,
competent, and friendly web developer! Email me: <mxhold@gmail.com>.

Or if you're not hiring and just want to hear more from me in the future, follow
me on Twitter: [@maxholder](http://twitter.com/maxholder).

Thanks for reading!
